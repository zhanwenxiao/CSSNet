To address 3D multi-task semantic change detection, we propose a Cross-task Symbiosis Siamese Network, named CSSNet, mainly including two modules, Change-augmented Semantic Segmentation module (CaSS) and Semantic-supplementary Change Detection module (SsCD). In CSSNet, the CaSS module augments the semantic segmentation performance by implicitly incorporating change features, and the SsCD module is responsible for detecting change supplemented by semantic features. These two modules deeply couple the two tasks in a unified architecture, fully leveraging inter-task dependencies to synergistically enhance both objectives. The experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency of CSSNet on 3D multi-task semantic change detection.
